Hm.. you're an odd one. 
You're not from 'round here are ya? 
Never seen anyone of your kind before..
You know, there was a bright light flash not too long ago and a lot of stars were scattered around the area. 
Would they happen to be yours?
Maybe you should collect them, you never know what you could need these for.
I'm tard by the way, nice to meet you!
